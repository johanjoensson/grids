# Grids

Grids/maps of various geometric shapes (starting with hexagons).

The hexagon stuff is a c++ implementation of the Hexagon grid/map described at redblobgames, [found here](www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons).

At some point it might include more than c++ stuff code, maybe a Python interface?
